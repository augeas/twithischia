## Twithischia

([Stegosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus) is of the order [Ornithischia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischia), or bird-hipped
dinosaurs. This is the only value of this repository, educational or otherwise.)

Twithischia is a [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) implementation of
[@GalacticFurball's](https://twitter.com/GalacticFurball)
[Twitter steganography](https://twitter.com/GalacticFurball/status/1439259660658241539), instead of the nice one done with
[ImageMagick](https://github.com/discatte/tweetdoom).

As it can run in a Jupyter Notebook via MyBinder, it can be kinda-sorta
deemed to run in the browser, until [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/))
happens.

To use the notebook in MyBinder, select "Run All Cells" from the "Run" menu. You'll have to download your .zip file from
the files tab on the left-hand side.

Now, go and hasten the Heat-Death of the Universe:
